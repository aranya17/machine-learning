This analysis investigated the performance of various machine learning models for predicting wine quality. 
The models evaluated were Support Vector Classification (SVC), Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree, and Random Forest. 
Based on the Accuracy and F1-Score metrics, the Random Forest model emerged as the most effective predictor of wine quality. 
It achieved an Accuracy of 0.689956 and an F1-Score of 0.672463, indicating a strong ability to correctly classify wine quality and balance precision with recall.
